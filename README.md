TweetTweet
==========
* A web application that implements a simple Twitter clone, built using the Flask web microframework, Bootstrap front-end framework, Jinja template engine, and SQLite RDBMS.

#### User Stories
* Users should be able to register for an account
* Users should be able to log in 
	* Don't worry about sessions. Assume the user is not closing the window and opening it
	* Don't worry about password hashing
* After logging in Users should be able to see all the posts
* Users can make their own post that appear on a personal page
* Users can click a repost button on a post that is not theirs. 

#### Planning
* PLAN OUT YOUR APPLICATION!
* Planning lowers the time it takes to develop an app. 
* What will your endpoints be?
	* What endpoint will render an HTML file?
	* What endpoint will send back JSON data?
* How might your database look like?
	* We'll have at least two models, one for Users and one for posts
	* THINK about this idea of reposting. If a user clicks a repost how will that look in the database? 
* What will your templates look like?

#### Luxury Goals
* Add User Sessions
* Add Password Hashing for User Login
* Make things look pretty - Honestly your app could look like crap, I just want it to work. If it works then feel free to make it look like better crap.
* Use Mustache.js for templating - Again, Mustache.js isn't needed but if you've tried it recently and you understand it, it can help with showing data dynamically
* Use `hashtags` to tag keywords - Really hard luxury goal
* Add a search bar that can search for those keywords

#### Deployment
* Deploy the web application on a VPS from DigitalOcean running Ubuntu 16.04, with NGINX and firewalld.
* Check with `systemctl status firewalld` and `firewall-cmd â€”list-all`.
